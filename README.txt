							 Application aim:
							=================
The aim of the application is to:
1) Gauge the security risk of a startup
2) Assess their security posture

So far, the application can do the first point.
The application can now pick a specific case for eg "online services", which was added today and give an abstract score.
A function has been included in the program for modularization.

I was able to run it from the latest version of eclipse, and from the Windows command line.
(You should have the latest version of python installed on your machine)

							============================
							 How the application works:
							============================

Select/Type in your industry from the 4 choices (Defense, Finance, Public Sector, Charity, Other) - Press enter
Your choice is case-sensitive. You can also leave it blank i.e. Not applicable (Other for now).

Then Select/Type in the answers to the following three questions and Press enter each time.
There's only three questions which highlights three security domains of this decision phase (That will increase as we go along)
Your choice is case-sensitive. You can also leave it blank which is equivalent to "No".

If it works well, You should get different types of outputs namely (Very high, High, Medium, Low, Very low).
